# Learning & Studying MongoDB with Stephen Grider
Using Stephen Grider's Udemy Course on: [*The Complete Developers Guide to MongoDb*](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-developers-guide-to-mongodb/learn/v4/content), I learn to master MongoDB & Mongoose design with a test-driven approach.

### Users
This project **'users'** is me walking through the course and familarizing myself with Mongoose, MongoDb, & MochaJS.

### Installation
* Download or Clone the repo &
* Run `npm install` in the root directory to install all dependencies
* Open console and type: `npm run test`. That will kick off the validation suite.

### MongoDB
